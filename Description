Description of the project:
I will be programming a Texas Hold'em style poker game with an interface where users on a server can play with
each other. Users can also play with bots that have been taught the rules and goals of the game of poker. They will follow
a set of logical arguments for the decision-making process to try and re-enact a rational player. Since each player is
connected to an account on the server, they will be able to keep track of their tokens (chips) won/lost and view
stats about their playing history.

Libraries and features that you will be using/implementing:
The interface will be programmed using the tkinter library. In addition, I will be using the sockets, random, time, os,
scipy, and numpy libraries for additional features. 

Description of the user interface for the project:
A user will log on to a dedicated server. Then, he/she will be able to either play poker with others on the server or bots.
The interface will be a traditional poker table with (up to) nine seats for players. When it’s the player’s turn he/she will
have these options: fold, check, bet/call, or raise.

Set of features (with descriptions) that you will implement and demo by first milestone date of November 25:
Working poker game (with minimum two players, maximum nine players), without interface but with commands in shell. Players
can play with each other through the server. An odds calculator will have been programmed too but this will only be used
for the bot's code in the future.

Final set of complete features (with descriptions) that will be part of your final submission and demo on Thursday Dec 6:
Users can log in to a server and choose between multiple tables (if more than nine users online) to play poker games with
eachother. They may also play with bots. Visually, each user will see their "personal" hole cards and the "public" cards
after the flop, the turn, and the river on a traditional poker table.
